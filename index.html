        <h2>Background</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Lancet Commission Report (2017) on 'Alleviating the access abyss in palliative care and pain
                relief—an imperative of universal health coverage', emphasises the huge burden of Serious Health-related
                Suffering across the world, with maximum incidence in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
            </li>
            <li>Suffering is health-related when it is associated with illness or injury of any kind. Suffering is
                serious when it cannot be relieved without professional intervention and/or when it compromises
                physical, social, spiritual, and/or emotional functioning.
            </li>
            <li>Patients with life-threatening and life-limiting conditions such as cancer, endure “serious
                health-related suffering” (SHS), which remain unrecognised and unaddressed.
            </li>
            <li>Identifying the SHS of patients at physical, psychological, social, spiritual, and/or financial, is the
                first active step towards alleviating and addressing them.
            </li>
            <li>The SHS Screening Tool (English) has been developed by the research group, under the aegis of the
                National Cancer Grid -India. The group used a systematic consensus building process during the Phase 1
                of the study (Delphi methodology, Nominal Group Technique, Transparent Expert Consultation, and public
                polling) and proceeded to complete a multi-centric field-test across nine major cancer-care institutions
                in India during the Phase 2. The results show acceptable validity and feasibility.
            </li>
            <li>The SHS-tool presented below, is validated to screen for Serious Health-related Suffering in adult
                patients with cancer, who reach cancer-care settings.
            </li>
            <li>Institutions planning to utilize the SHS- tool must have processes in place to activate an in-depth
                evaluation and enable access to an Essential Palliative Care Package for patients identified as having
                SHS.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions for use</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Use the Tool to screen for Serious Health-related Suffering, be it due to the cancer or its treatment.
            </li>
            <li>The Tool is better suited for screening patients during their review visits, to be administered by
                trained personnel sharing rapport with them.
            </li>
            <li>Identify and approach patients with cancer (adult, English comprehending) at clinical settings selected
                by the institution: waiting are / in-patient ward/ day care.
            </li>
            <li>Respectfully introduce yourself and build rapport with patient and family, e.g. enquire how they are
                doing, how long they have been on treatment, their travel to hospital etc.
            </li>
            <li>Enquire about their interest to screen for concerns related to their health-condition.
            </li>
            <li>Explain that the aim is to note their suffering over the previous 2 weeks, irrespective of whether it is
                due to the cancer or the treatment.
            </li>
            <li>Encourage the family-member, bystander to allow and support the patient to respond directly.
            </li>
            <li>Once they indicate willingness, note the patient's demographic details, and administer section 1 of
                post-field-test SHS Screening Tool,
                <ul>
                    <li>Begin with reading out the domain question asking for presence of any concern in that domain,
                        pause…..
                        then, read out the items listed under it</li>
                    <li>Clarify that the items listed are examples only, of concerns commonly seen under that domain;
                        encourage the patient to share any other cause for suffering, which may not have been listed.
                    </li>
                    <li>Give time and allow the patient to comprehend and consider their response for each domain.</li>
                    <li>Note the severity of suffering under each domain, by using the scoring system</li>
                    <li>If the patient shares concern other than those listed as items, score its severity, under the
                        appropriate domain.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Maintain an unhurried attitude right through; clarify questions and respond to their doubts.
            </li>
            <li> Total score of 0 or 1 from section 1 of the-Tool indicates No SHS. Here, it may be appropriate to
                continue screening for SHS at pre-decided intervals, as per the Institutional policy.
            </li>
            <li> If section-1 yields total score > 2, ask the two questions under Section 2 of the-Tool. Note the Yes /
                No response.
            </li>
            <li> Use the Interpretation table to mark the presence or absence of SHS.
            </li>
            <li> Thank the patient for their time and proceed further based on the output of the Tool.
            </li>
            <li> Patients who do not wish to engage or respond may exit at any stage. They may be encouraged to have a
                one-on-one conversation with their treating clinician regarding their concerns (if any).
